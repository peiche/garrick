# Garrick

Garrick is a next-generation theme for WordPress users.

Its primary focus is on making sure that your content is front and center with fast page loads. It's primarily designed for the WordPress block editor but works great with the classic editor as well.

Garrick is a commercial theme. Its code is in a public repository on GitHub so that other developers can learn from it and contribute code. If using the theme in any way, please make a purchase from the official Tavern Theme Page.

- PHP 5.6+ (preferably 7+).
- WordPress 5.2+.
- Gutenberg 5.6+ or WordPress 5.2+ for Gutenberg block styles.
