# Garrick

Garrick is a modern, multi-purpose theme built to be compatible with Gutenberg, the WordPress core block editor and page builder. Personalize your website from the built-in Customizer, including choosing from hundreds of supported Google Fonts.

Garrick is based on the Mythic theme by Justin Tadlock, and is modular in nature. Copy any file inside the `resources/views` directory to your child theme and edit. Change as little or as much as you want! The theme uses the CodyFrame framework, making all utility classes available in Gutenberg blocks.

## Requirements

There's a few requirements in order to develop a new theme or contribute back to the project:

- PHP 5.6+ (preferably 7+).
- WordPress 5.2+.
- Gutenberg 5.6+ or WordPress 5.2+ for Gutenberg block styles.
